<p>Welcome to Ocelot Consulting.  Sounds really good to say that, but who are we, what do we do, why do you care?  </p>

<p>Let's start with the who we are.  A group of dedicated technology experts, who have a passion for solving complex problems. That has led us to deep expertise in cloud, security, web development, and analytics. We recently completed building an enterprise web platform followed enterprise cloud platform for a Fortune 200 company.  Adoption was easy, and rapid because the automation and tooling made it developer friendly.  Most of all, adoption was easy because it flat out worked. </p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of our company is our culture.  Collaboration, challenging ideas, and agility set the tone for everything we do. We believe the people you bring into a company are the most important factor into the success or failure of that venture. We only select the most talented individuals who also have a passion for learning and helping others. </p>

<p>What we do is help companies with their technology hurdles. Deciding on how and when to move to cloud? We can help.  Deciding which cloud provider to use or how to secure your infrastructure?  Yes, we can help. Looking to create a more user friendly interface and then gain insights through analytics?  Again, we can help. I could go on, but I think you get the point. We have worked across many industries with all sorts of technologies and challenges. </p>

<p>Many of you have heard similar stories, the old “we can do that”, or “we only hire talented people”  only to be disappointed when you actually start to work with them.  We have definitely all heard the same song and dance.  We will not make empty promises. We want to partner with you to help solve your technology challenges.  There are only a few consulting companies who actually live up to that, and we will be one of them.  </p>

<p>Beyond forming these partnerships, we also want to give back to the IT community as a whole.  As such, we will be posting in this blog on relevant subjects to the technologies we are either currently working in, or have passion around.  We hope to spark conversation, interest in our company, and generally educate. </p>

<p>So, where are we now?  Well, we just started 3 days ago, we are in the process of finding those partners, and things look promising so far. </p>

<p>You or your firm can be a part of our journey. Feel free to <a href="/#contact">contact us</a> at any time. And stay tuned for future posts and news.</p>
