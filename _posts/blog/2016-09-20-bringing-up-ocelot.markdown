<blockquote> “We are currently not planning on conquering the world.” —Sergey Brin, Google co-founder</blockquote>

<p>Well, it happened. We've launched Ocelot Consulting as an LLC upon an unsuspecting world.</p>

<p>Currently, we are trying to hit the ground running, exercising our personal professional networks and looking to secure clients and contracts to begin engineering work in the weeks to come.</p>

<p>Where will this ultimately lead? We'd be lying if we said we knew. However, we do know that we'd regret never trying. So in that vein, we've decided to pour our entire selves into creating Ocelot Consulting as a reality.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we see ourselves working on exciting projects, innovating and creating value for both our clients and our owners. To do that, we'll need to hold true to the virtues we've come to value as part of this initial entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Next Frontier</h2>

<p>To us, Ocelot has meant freedom. Freedom from poor decisions handed down from out-of-touch leadership. Freedom to pursue ideas which move the ball forward, past cliches like that just use to the point where we are helping to advance IT technology used in development and cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>How will we know when we've reached our goals? Frankly, when we have new goals. Currently our goals are to build a sustainable consulting practice with several happy clients, and a place where people love to come to work. Emergent leadership, merit-based recognition, and yada.</p>

<p>How or when that will be possible remains to be seen. We have benchmarks and projections which we think are achievable.</p>

<p>You or your firm can be a part of our journey. Feel free to <a href="/#contact">contact us</a> at any time. And stay tuned for future posts and news.</p>
